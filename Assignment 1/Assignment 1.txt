1)Check the given number is EVEN or ODD?

STEP 1: Start.

STEP 2: Read a number from user to N.

STEP 3: Divide the number by 2 and store the remainder in R.

STEP 4: If R = O Then go to STEP 6.
        else
          

STEP 5: Print “N is odd” go to STEP 7.

STEP 6: Print “N is even”

STEP 7: Stop.


2) Write a Java Program to find the Factorial of given number?

STEP 1: Start
 
STEP 2: Declare Variable n, fact, i 

STEP 3: Read number from User 

STEP 4: Initialize Variable fact=1 and i=1 

STEP 5: Repeat Until i<=number 
  5.1   fact=fact*i 
  5.2   i=i+1 

STEP 6: Print fact 

STEP 7: Stop


First take input from user and store that value in variable named “n”. 
Then we initialize a variable “Fact” with value 1 (i.e Fact=1) and variable i with value 1(i.e i=1). 
Repeat next two STEPs until i is less than n.

Multiply Fact with current value of i

Increment i with 1

At last, print the value of Fact.

For eg,
Let the input be 5.
The equation that gets created by our algorithm is 5x4x3x2x1.
So, The Factorial of 5 is 120(5x4x3x2x1).



3) Find the Factorial of a number using Recursion?

STEP 1: Start.

STEP 2: Take input from user n.

        factorial(n).(goto the STEP 6)

STEP 4: Print output.

STEP 5: Stop.

STEP 6: Check condition  if(n==1)
                                return 1.
                          else
                               again call function until( n==1)
                               factorial(n).


4)Swap two numbers without using third variable approach.

STEP 1: Start.

STEP 2: Take input from user x, y.

STEP 3: print the given input.

STEP 4: Adding given numbers and store it into any one variable out of two 
               x = x + y.

STEP 5:  y= x - y.

STEP 6:  x= x - y.

STEP 7: PRINT x, y.

STEP 8: END.


Eg. suppose the numbers are

x=10 ,y=15.

adding  x and y store it into x.

 x=10+15=25.

subtraction will be happen
y = x - y =25-15=10
y=10;===========>number will be swapped

x = x - y =25-10=15
X=15============>number will be swapped
